The Gunther project is a scheduler, made primarily to run executable files at certain times.

The scheduler should be able to be a stand-alone GUI program that will:
	1. Display its schedule in a grid.
	2. Allow a selected item in that schedule to be run by clicking a button.
	3. Allow the "current time" of the scheduler to be changed.
	4. Display the actual time and the current time.
	5. Allow a different scheduled jobs source to be selected (file selector, or database).

The scheduler should be able to be a command-line program that will display the schedule.

The scheduler should be able to be a component in an app network, with it's information available via channel requests on the network.
